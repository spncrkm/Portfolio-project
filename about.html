                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Spencer Kim, and I am based in the DC metro area/northern Virginia. I hold an associate degree in Computer Science, and after a diverse career journey, I am currently pursuing my passion for coding through a full stack engineering bootcamp.</p>
                
                <p>I began my academic journey in computer science, but life took me on a different path. I spent a decade working at my brother's business and then at a bakery. Despite these detours, my enthusiasm for technology never waned, and I made the decision to return to my passionâ€”coding.</p>
                
                <p>Although I am still in the bootcamp and building my portfolio, I have worked on small projects such as creating a database in MySQL and developing an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project for a library system. My current focus is on backend development, a field I am deeply committed to mastering.</p>
                
                <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy playing PC games and spending quality time with my two daughters. These hobbies not only provide a balance to my professional life but also inspire creativity and strategic thinking in my coding projects.</p>
                
                <p>My goal is to become a proficient and skilled backend developer. I believe in working hard and continually improving my skills to achieve greatness in this field. I am dedicated to not just getting by but excelling and making a meaningful impact in the tech world.</p>
